# Stargate

**Signature-based function discovery**

Stargate is a novel Rust library that takes a fundamentally different approach to locating Windows API functions. Instead of relying on easily-hooked structures like the PEB or Export Address Table, Stargate uses signature-based scanning to find functions in memory. Used in combination with [moonwalk](https://github.com/Teach2Breach/moonwalk) to avoid PEB walking to locate target dll base addresses. Together moonwalk and stargate represent a novel approach to locating windows API function addresses in memory.

**Why this matters:** Traditional function location techniques follow well-trodden paths that defenders have learned to monitor. Stargate treats function discovery as a pattern matching problem rather than a structure parsing problem.

For detailed technical information, see [blog.md](blog.md).

## üéØ Key Features

- **Signature-Based Function Location**: Find functions by their byte signatures instead of EAT parsing
- **Enhanced Hook Detection**: Advanced inline hook detection with syscall pattern recognition
- **Runtime Function Discovery**: Locate functions in currently loaded DLLs at runtime
- **Version-Specific Signatures**: Extract and use signatures specific to the exact DLL version
- **Memory-Based Database**: Fast in-memory signature storage without external dependencies
- **Multi-DLL Support**: Works with any loaded Windows DLL (ntdll, kernel32, etc.)

## üöÄ How It Works

Instead of asking "where is the export table pointing?", Stargate asks "what does this function look like in memory?"

### The Process
1. **Get Clean DLLs**: Download unmodified DLL files from Microsoft's Symbol Server
2. **Extract Signatures**: Pull unique byte patterns from function beginnings
3. **Find Loaded DLLs**: Use Moonwalk to locate DLLs in memory (no PEB walking)
4. **Pattern Match**: Scan memory for matching signatures
5. **Detect Hooks**: Identify when functions have been modified
6. **Return Addresses**: Get the actual runtime function locations

### Enhanced Hook Detection
Stargate provides advanced inline hook detection capabilities:
- **Syscall Pattern Recognition**: Detect ntdll syscall prologue modifications (4C 8B D1)
- **Multiple Hook Patterns**: Identify JMP, CALL, PUSH+RET, and MOV+JMP patterns
- **Inline Hook Detection**: Find modified bytes within function bodies
- **Target Address Analysis**: Analyze hook redirect targets for suspicious patterns
- **Relocation Search**: Find functions that have been moved
- **Alternative Locations**: Check common relocation patterns

## üì¶ Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
stargate = { git = "https://github.com/Teach2Breach/stargate.git" }
```

## üîß Quick Start

### Silent Usage (Recommended for Implants)
```rust
use stargate::*;
use std::ffi::c_void;

type NtQuerySystemTimeFunc = extern "system" fn(lpSystemTime: *mut i64) -> i32;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Extract signatures silently (ntdll recommended for strict environments)
    let db = extract_all_signatures("ntdll", 32)?;
    
    // Find and call function with minimal output
    if let Some(result) = find_specific_function("ntdll", "NtQuerySystemTime", &db) {
        let query_time: NtQuerySystemTimeFunc = unsafe { 
            std::mem::transmute(result.found_address as *const c_void) 
        };
        let mut system_time = 0i64;
        let status = query_time(&mut system_time);
        // Only print essential result
        println!("NtQuerySystemTime: {} (status: {})", system_time, status);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Extract Signatures from Clean DLLs

```rust
// Extract all signatures from a clean DLL (version detected automatically)
// Recommended: Use ntdll for strict environments
let db = extract_all_signatures("ntdll", 32)?;
println!("Extracted {} signatures", db.len());

// Extract single function signature
let sig = extract_single_signature("ntdll", "NtQuerySystemTime", 32)?;

// Note: kernel32 scanning may trigger security products in strict environments
// let sig = extract_single_signature("kernel32", "Sleep", 32)?; // Use with caution
```

### Scan Loaded DLLs for Functions

```rust
// Scan entire DLL (recommended: ntdll for strict environments)
let results = scan_loaded_dll("ntdll", &db)?;

// Find specific function
let result = find_specific_function("ntdll", "NtQuerySystemTime", &db)?;

// Scan all loaded DLLs (use with caution in strict environments)
let all_results = scan_all_loaded_dlls(&db);

// Note: kernel32 scanning may trigger security products
// let result = find_specific_function("kernel32", "Sleep", &db)?; // Use with caution
```

### Analyze Results

```rust
for result in results {
    println!("Function: {}", result.function_name);
    println!("  Found at: 0x{:x}", result.found_address);
    println!("  Expected RVA: 0x{:x}", result.expected_rva);
    println!("  Actual RVA: 0x{:x}", result.actual_rva);
    println!("  Hooked: {}", result.hook_detected);
    println!("  Confidence: {:.1}%", result.confidence_score * 100.0);
}
```

## üéÆ Command Line Interface

```bash
# Extract signatures from ntdll
cargo run -- ntdll

# Extract and scan for specific function
cargo run -- ntdll NtQuerySystemTime

# Extract with custom signature length
cargo run -- kernel32 Sleep 64
```

### Silent Function Calling (Recommended for Implants)
For opsec-sensitive operations and implants, use the silent example that minimizes output and avoids kernel32:
```bash
cargo run --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --example silent_call
```

**Example Output:**
```
NtQuerySystemTime: 133970745314599291 (status: 0)
```

This example demonstrates clean function calling with minimal logging - only prints the function name and result, and uses ntdll for maximum opsec.

- **Hot Patching**: Locate functions for runtime modification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Memory Access**: Requires read access to process memory
- **Signature Reliability**: Signatures may change between Windows versions
- **Hook Detection**: Not all hooking techniques may be detected
- **Performance**: Scanning large DLLs can be resource-intensive
- **EDR Triggers**: Scanning all of kernel32.dll may trigger security products in strict environments - more testing is needed

**Why ntdll-only scanning is recommended:**
- `ntdll.dll` contains the core Windows NT functions that are less likely to be monitored
- `kernel32.dll` scanning has been observed to trigger some security products - more testing is needed to patch a solution
- Most critical functions can be accessed through ntdll equivalents
- Reduces the attack surface for detection
- Enhanced hook detection works best with ntdll syscall patterns

**When to scan kernel32:**
- Development and testing environments
- Research and analysis scenarios
- When specific kernel32 functions are required
- In environments where you have confirmed EDR behavior
